Source_FBX.rar contains source files of 3D models.

If you want to modify and integrate these files in your project,
just unpack the archive into current folder (EternalTemple\Source_FBX\FileName.fbx).

When you next time load your project, please click "Don't Import" when a little window
pops up, telling you that UE detected changes to source files. You only need to do this once.

Please note that every model in the pack comes with a custom collision. If a collision
of any model looks broken or autogenerated, please make sure that "Auto Generate Collision" is
unchecked in the import settings and "Customized Collision" is checked.

For some of the models, UE4 sets the source file path to the same location as the static mesh.
Not sure why this happens, but if you have problems reimporting a model, check the
source file path in the import settings of the static mesh.
